# Hardware Programmer

So far the fastest general-purpose AVR hardware programmer that I have used is [USBasp](http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/) clones of which are available on eBay at a low cost.

Other options will not work out of the box with Arduino, Atmel Studio, and avrdude.

#### ISP Header

When it's time to plug in the eeZee Tiny board, locate the white rectangle next to the ISP header which marks pin 1. Here's what it looks like on an eeZeeTiny841. Other eeZeeTiny boards' ISP headers look the same.
