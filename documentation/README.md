## Introduction

The new, powerful ATtiny841 features 14 pins, two USARTs, SPI, I2C slave, three timers, ADC and more. The eeZeeTiny841 board exposes all pins and adds a reset circuit, AVR ISP programming interface, bypass capacitors, and optional crystal: all in a compact breadboard-friendly form factor.

## Reference

### Fuses

* For eeZeeTiny841 fuses, see [ATtiny841 Fuses](Tiny841Fuses.md).
* For other eeZeeTiny boards, use the [Engbedded Fuse Calculator](http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc/).

### Operating Conditions

Please use your ATtiny breakout boards with regulated supplies of 5V or less, with minimal ripple, at temperatures around 25C (77F). Do not use the boards in high temperature conditions.

### Default Image

During testing, I flash the *larson scanner* example software onto the chip and then test every pin for connectivity. You can find the code in the ```examples``` directory of this repo.
